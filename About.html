    <h2>DK Vinyl Studio Story</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Hi, I am Kalaya, main person behind the DK Vinyl Studio and my husband helps me with all deliveries. Sometimes our little ones, Lilly and Ethan, help me with packing orders too. We are from a small town in West Yorkshire called Mirfield. We love to create T-shirts, Canvas Bags, Mugs and Hoodies using Heat Transfer Vinyl and Sublimation. We also love to create and design custom orders and had very high satisfaction from our customers. If you’re looking for something different than designs on high street for you or your loved ones, you’ve come to the right place. You will be guaranteed for best customer service from us and also quality products. Every product we made has all love and attention.
